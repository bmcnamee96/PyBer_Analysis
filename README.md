# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the ride data between the months of January and April. This data created a multi-line plot for the total fare by city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) between the above months. We were able to see the best and worst months for each city type.

#### Total Fares ($63,538.64)

## Summary
### Business Recommendations
1) Having less Urban drivers may be an important change as these drivers are not making much money at all. When compared to Rural and Suburban, Urban drivers are making less than 1/3 and 1/2 respectively. Although there are more riders in Urban areas, there are too many drivers.
2) Urban areas are the most profitable overall for the company as there are so many riders.  In order to increase profits in other areas, a price drop may be needed.
3) All areas have a pretty high variability of profits over the months that were analyzed. Trying to predict the total profit for future may be difficult, but one thing is certain to happen: Urban will be the most profitable, Suburban will be the second most profitable, and Rural will be the least profitable.
